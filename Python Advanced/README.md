# Python Advanced
## Course details
The course "Python Advanced" builds on Python language skills by addressing more complex language-specific concepts (such as modules and comprehension). In the course the students will learn to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with stacks and queues, tuples and sets, matrices (Multidimensional Lists), files and directories. Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. The students will take a closer look at lamba functions, recursive functions, and multi-argument functions.

## Acquired skills
•	Working with 2D data structure;

•	Creating linear data structures;

•	Application of basic algorithms;
